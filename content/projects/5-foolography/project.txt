Title: Foolography

----

Description:

The Unleashed puts complete control over your DSLR into the palm of your hand â€“ right from your smartphone.

I was hired to help create the digital mobile experience for a hardware product. This product would be used mainly by photography professionals so I wanted to go with a visual style that fit the user and product. I research and testing a lot of cameras to understand the controls and determine how to represent them in the app.
